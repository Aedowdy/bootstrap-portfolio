			<p>I didn't know where to go... there were so many things going on... I had hit my breaking point. 
					I realized this was not going to change unless I did something about it. 
					It was mid June, nearly two years after I started working for "The company". 
					I had been giving eight hours of my life every day to this place... 
					Has time passed so quickly? Have I moved at all? Is there light at the end of the tunnel? 
					These are the questions I asked myself every day. 
					Wondering when that magical thing was going to just fall into my lap and my life would change forever... Until one day, It did.
                    Well not in the way I had pictured it, but it certainly took me by surprise.
            </p>
                    
			<p>You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. 
					Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.
					And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.
					As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. 
                    And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.
            </p>
